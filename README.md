Hi there, my name is [George](https://georgeprofile.netlify.app/)! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently interested in web development. I love working with HTML/CSS (Sass/SCSS), JavaScript (jQuery/AJAX technologies/Vue), and PHP (Laravel). Also, I enjoy doing some [designs](https://figma.com/@rofl/) (UX/UI).

At present, I am working on my diploma project and some mini projects involving various languages.

In the past, I developed Discord Bots using JavaScript and the discord.js library. Maybe someday I will upload them to GitHub.

Some of my public repos:
